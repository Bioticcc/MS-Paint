# Bighard Paint
Bighard Paint is an image creation tool similar to Microsoft Paint or Photoshop. What it lacks in power, functionality and design, it makes up for in ( &nbsp; //TODO: Find something. Anything. &nbsp; ). Bighard Paint is a demonstration of the inheritance and polymorphism concepts we learned in CptS 122, as well as a review of the commenting and program design practices covered in CptS 121.

### Instructions:
1. Build and run the application using the ISO C++17 "Standard".
2. Once the application is running, select a brush from the lefthand sidebar (the red pencil is a great choice) and move the cursor to the canvas.
3. With a brush selected, click and drag the mouse in your desired pattern.
4. Watch as our Premium Programming Magicâ„¢ combines with our proprietary CanvasInk Technology (Pat.Pend.) to bring your drawing to life!
5. When you have finished your masterpiece, press "Save" to store it to your hard drive. Now print your signature piece to share with "Friends", Family, and Random Internet Strangers!
